Please check the link for more details.\nEdit Mode Operators\r#\rThere are multiple buttons in the Edit mode panel, which are shortcuts of the same operator. This operator takes the paths of selected strokes as the input, and generate new strokes which are results of the boolean operation. You can choose to keep the input strokes or delete them.\nIt is possible, but not recommended to select strokes from multiple layers, since it is not intuitive to judge in which layer the output strokes should be generated and how they should be arranged.\rStroke Attributes\r#\rThe output strokes inherit the point attributes of the input strokes, including radius, strength, depth and vertex color. However, if the input strokes have different stroke attributes, e.g., the fill color and the assigned material, the output strokes can only choose one of them to inherit. There is an option to specify the criterion for such inheritance.\nCases of 3 or More Shapes\r#\rThe expected result of two input strokes is straightforward. However, with three or more input strokes, there may be multiple ways to finish the operation.\nThe figure above is an example of performing the Difference operation on 3 shapes. The numbers of Subjects and Clips need to be specified in the options.\nAlso, the sequence of stroke selection matters. The first selected strokes are regarded as Subjects, and the last selected strokes are Clips.\nDraw Mode Operators\r#\rThe boolean operators are also available in the Draw mode. In this mode, it will take the lastest drawn stroke as the Clip, and perform the operation on each stroke overlapping with it in the same layer.\nThere is an option to use the line radius as the Clip path. This resembles the experience of the erasor tool in raster painting software, as shown in the figure above.\r"},{"id":2,"href":"/nijigp/docs/functionality/io/brushes/","title":"Brush Import","section":"- Import/Export -","content":"\rBrush Import\r#\rThe ABR/GBR Brushes button is an operator that converts .abr and .gbr brush files, which are widely used in software including Adobe Photoshop, GIMP and Krita, into Grease Pencil materials/brushes.\nIt may take a long time to parse high resolution (e.g. 2500px * 2500px) brushes, because the brush images need to be uncompressed. The time further increases if the file contains multiple brushes.\nIf you want to use the high resolution brushes repeatedly, you may consider save the brushes in a .blend file and link/append from it in the future, which may be faster than importing the brushes all over again.\nTemplate Brush\r#\rSince the .abr and .gbr brushes are designed for raster graphics and work in a different way from Grease Pencil, this add-on in fact only extracts the images from the brush file and use them as textures of new materials/brushes. All the original brush parameters will not be preserved.\nYou can select an existing Grease Pencil brush as a template in the import options. All newly generated brushes will use the parameters of this brush.\nColor Modes\r#\rExcept some RGB .gbr brushes (which are not very common), a brush usually has only a single color channel as the texture. You can choose to use this channel as either alpha/transparency or the grayscale color in the import options.\nWhen using the channel as alpha, you can specify black or white as the texture color.\nSave Brush Icons\r#\rDespite the brush textures saved in the .blend file, the brush thumbnails shown in the Tool panel are separate image files, and have to be saved outside the .blend file.\nThere is an option specifying where to save these files. Deleting them will stop the brush from showing its thumbnail. However, the brush itself will not be impacted.\n(The example brushes shown in this page is from the SeerStuff set created by SeerLight.)\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/nijigp/docs/functionality/animation/frame_animation/","title":"Frame Animations","section":"- Animations -","content":"\rFrame Animations\r#\rMultiframe Operations\r#\rGrease Pencil has a Multiframe Tool allowing users to draw or edit on multiple frames at the same time.

If you have no experience with Blender add-ons that have similar requirements, it is strongly suggested to read this page before using the add-on.\nDependency Summary\r#\rThe table below lists the packages required for each type of operation. Lacking a package will not affect operations that do not require it. For example, if you install this add-on just to import brushes and render PSD files, then you do not need to take any actions mentioned in this page.\nFunction PyClipper Scipy \u0026amp; SkImage Triangle Polygon (Bool, Offset \u0026amp; Sweep) Yes Line Fitting Yes Line Shaping (Pinch, Taper) Smart Fill Yes Yes Mesh Generation [See Below] Yes Optional Optional Rigging Using Mesh Rigging Using Hints Yes Brush Import Line Art Import Yes Color Image Import Yes Yes SVG \u0026amp; Palette Paste PSD Render About Mesh Generation\nOnly pyclipper is a mandatory requirement. However, the other packages are optional to enable some enhancements of the Interpolation operator:\nscipy enables an advanced solver to calculate vertex depth. triangle enables an option to improve mesh quality, i.e., more uniformly distributed vertices. Impact of Operating Systems\r#\rThe add-on is available and has been tested in Windows, Linux and MacOS. However, there may be some specific issues in each OS:\nWindows\rDepending on the way Blender is installed, some additional attentions may be needed besides the normal package installation process.\nPortable or Steam: No additional action required. Official Installer: If Blender is installed in a system folder (e.g., C:\\Program Files\\Blender Foundation\\), it is recommended to run Blender as administrator to ensure the dependencies installed correctly. Microsoft Store: A custom package path is required to install packages. Normally, this will be handled automatically. Please refer to a later section for more information. MacOS\rThe triangle package is not yet available for Apple silicon (M1/M2) devices. Please skip installing this package. It has only minor negative effects.\rPackage Installation\r#\rTo install Python packages, the most straightforward way is the dependency manager in the add-on setting of the Preferences panel.\nClick the \u0026ldquo;Check\u0026rdquo; button to detect which packages have been installed, and click \u0026ldquo;Install\u0026rdquo; button for those missing (Internet connection is required).\nThe logs during the installation will be printed in the panel, which will also indicate if the installation is successful. The \u0026ldquo;Remove\u0026rdquo; button works in the similar way to uninstall packages. However, it requires Blender to be restarted to apply the changes.\nIf the installation fails, the reason may be shown in the logs. You may also consider reading the following sections about the alternative methods and the FAQ.\nAlternative Method 1: Custom Package Path\r#\rNormally, packages are installed in Blender\u0026rsquo;s directory. However, in the Custom Package Path option, an additional path can be assigned for Blender to find and load the packages from. This option may be useful in the following scenarios:\nYou have multiple instances of Blender and/or Python installed, and do not want to download the packages repeatedly. You do not have the write access to the Blender directory (e.g., when Blender is installed through Microsoft Store). In the second case, the add-on will try to find this path automatically during the package installation. If that does not succeed, you may consider checking the following paths, which are some common places that packages may be installed to:\n\u0026#34;[Your Blender Directory]/3.x/python/lib/site-packages\u0026#34; (Windows) \u0026#34;%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Python\\Python310\\site-packages\u0026#34; (Linux) \u0026#34;~/.local/lib/python3.10/site-packages\u0026#34; Alternative Method 2: Manual Installation\r#\rThe Python packages are installed and managed by pip. For Python users knowing how pip works, the required packages can also be installed manually using the commmand line or terminal:\nEnter Blender\u0026rsquo;s directory in the command line. An official manual is available. Enable the pip module: ./python -m ensurepip --upgrade Install packages: ./python -m pip install pyclipper triangle scikit-image You may consider these options when using pip: --no-cache-dir, --force-reinstall, --only-binary.\rFAQ\r#\rThe package installation succeeded, but the package status is still \u0026ldquo;Not Installed\u0026rdquo;.\rThis usually happens when you do not have the write access of the Blender directory, and the packages are automatically installed somewhere else. The path is usually shown in the logs. Please check if there are some lines containing a path ending with site-packages. If such a path can be found in the logs, refer to the Custom Package Path method and enter this path.\rBlender stops responding after hitting the Install button.\rIt is common that the download and installation may take some time. However, if Blender has no reponse for a long time, there might be network issues. Please make sure you have the Internet connection, and maybe use VPN if necessary.\nIt is possible that the display of logs can be lagged, until the operation finishes. To see the logs in real time, the same messages will also be shown in [Window] - [Toggle System Console] and without lags.\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/nijigp/docs/tips/scene_setup/","title":"Scene Setup","section":"Tips","content":"\rScene Setup\r#\rBlender comes with a template start file \u0026ldquo;2D Animation\u0026rdquo; that is convenient for painting. However, there are also some tricky parts in setting up the scene, especially when we put Grease Pencil and 3D objects in the same scene, including the meshes generated by this add-on. Here are some tips written in the form of FAQ.\nWhy cannot I see any shading effect when I generate meshes from Grease Pencil?\rThe default 2D Animation scene does not have any light sources. So we have to add some light objects to the scene ourselves.\nIn addition, please change the Viewport Shading to Render Preview mode and make sure that the scene lights are enabled.\nIf you do not want to set light sources, you can try the MatCap materials when generating meshes, which have the lighting information baked in and do not need scene lights.\nWhy is the lighting on 2D and 3D objects not consistent?\rThe environment background colors for 2D and 3D objects are not the same. In the [Scene]\u0026gt;[World] panel:\nthe lighting of 3D objects is determined by Surface and Volume tabs, but the lighting of Grease Pencil is determined by the Viewport Display tab. Please make sure that these two color values are the same if you want to make the lighting more consistent across all objects.\nWhy is the color drawn on the canvas slightly different from my material setting?\rYou may notice that the color displayed in the viewport is slightly different from the color you selected in the Brush or Material settings. This can cause some problems, such as getting the wrong color when using the Eyedropper tool.\nThis happens because the default background color is not actually white, although it looks very similar. The exact color is #F9F9F9.\nTo keep the color as it is, you can either set the viewport background color to pure white or uncheck the \u0026ldquo;Use Lights\u0026rdquo; option of the Grease layer.\nWhy does Grease Pencil obstruct all 3D objects regardless of depth, unlike what I see in the preview?\rThere are two options determining whether Grease Pencil will be rendered above all 3D objects:\nIn the [Scene]\u0026gt;[ViewLayer] panel, when Z pass is disabled (as by default), Grease Pencil objects will be rendered above all 3D objects. (But in the preview, it appears at the correct location.) In the [Object] properties panel, when \u0026ldquo;In Front\u0026rdquo; is checked in the Viewport Display tab, this Grease Pencil object is both rendered and previewed at the top.

This is the major way of calling NijiGPen\u0026rsquo;s functions.\nNijiGPen operators are categorized in several panels. Depending on the current mode, different panels or operators may appear.\nThese operators do not have default shortcut keys. However, an option [Assign Shortcut] is available in the operator button\u0026rsquo;s right-click menu.\nTools\r#\rNijiGPen adds several new tools in the Toolbar of Grease Pencil Edit mode. The tool icons have a \u0026ldquo;2D\u0026rdquo; mark on them.\nThese tools have the same effect as the corresponding operators in the sidebar panel. However, they allow you to tune the parameters with mouse dragging instead of typing numbers.\nViewport Buttons (Optional)\r#\rNijiGPen also adds some buttons at the bottom of the 3D Viewport window. They are shortcuts of the following functions:\nUndo/redo Tilt the canvas Arrange selected strokes forward/backward The purpose of these shortcut buttons is to enhance the user experience on touchscreens (e.g., Microsoft Surface), inspired by popular painting/design software on tablets. They can be triggered by either the mouse or a stylus.\nIf you do not need these buttons or find them conflicting with other add-ons, you can change their position or turn them off in the setting of Preferences panel.\r2D Working Plane\r#\rMost of the add-on operators work in a 2D plane. If you are working with Blender\u0026rsquo;s 2D Animation template (using X-Z plane by default), there would be no problems. However, when working in the 3D space (e.g., painting on the surface of an object), the way of determining the 2D working plane should be paid attention to.\nIn the default mode (\u0026ldquo;Auto\u0026rdquo;), the add-on first estimates the coordinates of all input stroke points to determine the vectors of two most important dimensions. Then it uses the current view to determine the front/back and up/down directions. Please avoid selecting strokes belonging to more than one 2D plane as the input. In that case, the estimation can be wrong. (A warning message will show up when it happens.) There are also other modes available, including using the current view, or using an orthogonal plane (X-Y, X-Z or Y-Z). It can be set in the Global Setting panel. Applying a rotation in a Grease Pencil layer\u0026rsquo;s attribute may disturb the detection of the working plane. If you want to use layer rotation with NijiGPen, please make sure to check the Use Transform of Active Layer option and process strokes from a single layer per operation.\nOn the other hand, applying a rotation on the object itself or its parent has no negative effect on the plane detection.\n"},{"id":9,"href":"/nijigp/docs/get_started/","title":"Get Started","section":"Docs","content":""},{"id":10,"href":"/nijigp/docs/tips/limitations/","title":"Limitations","section":"Tips","content":"\rLimitations\r#\rThe add-on has a number of limitations in different aspects, including:\nUnfinished features of the add-on itself, which may be improved in future releases. Limitations due to Blender\u0026rsquo;s own design, which may lead to different behaviors from common graphics software. This page lists limitations which are general to multiple operators. Besides it, the constraints of 2D space can be found in Basic Usage. The limitation of each single operator will be recorded in their own page.\nShape of a Stroke\r#\rThe performance of the add-on may deteriorate with input strokes of certain shapes:\nPlease avoid using self-overlapping strokes. Unlike common vector formats such as SVG, Blender does not define a fill rule and the rendering of the overlapping parts cannot be guaranteed. Most operators ignore the overlapping parts automatically, but sometimes it also causes crashes. To eliminate these parts, you can use the Offset operator with a value of zero. It is also recommended not to have too few points or unevenly distributed points along the stroke, as this can lead to poor quality mesh generation or line cleanup results. The Resample button in the add-on panel can be used to quickly redistribute the stroke points. Holes\r#\rBoth this add-on and Blender itself have limitations supporting fill shapes will holes inside.\nBlender does not allow holes in a stroke, but some add-on operators like Boolean, Offset and SVG Paste can result in holes. In such cases, the corresponding geometry will be created, but will not be transparent. To display holes in Grease Pencil, Blender provides with a Holdout property in its material setting. The add-on also has a Hole Holdout operator to automatically set this property for shapes inside other shapes. In addition, some operators of the add-on have special behaviors when the input strokes have the holdout property. The mesh generation operator (currently only for the interpolation method) can turn these strokes into real holes in the mesh. The Offset and Sweep operators have the option to inverse the operation direction for these strokes. Vertex Groups\r#\rAfter some operators, including Boolean, Offset, and Line Cleanup, the weights of vertex groups are not preserved. If you need them for modifiers or rigging (including the rigging functions of this add-on), it is recommended to assign weights after using these operators.

NijiGPen provides with several alternative methods generating bone weights.\nThe rigging-related operations will show up in a panel when the current mode is Weight Paint.\nTransfer Weights from Meshes\r#\rThe Weight From Meshes button is a tool transferring the weights from rigged mesh objects to the current Grease Pencil object.\nThe operator requires an armature and one or more source mesh objects as the input. It sets the weights of the armature bones to stroke points according to the nearest vertex from the source mesh objects.\nIf the source objects are not rigged, the operator can rig them first using the With Automatic Weights parenting tool, and then perform the transfer, controlled by the option Use Existing Weights.\nSource Objects\r#\rFor 2D animations, one recommended way is to draw a silhouette of the target that you want to animate, and convert it to a mesh object using this add-on\u0026rsquo;s mesh generation operations. The silhouette does not need to be very precise, but in general a better-drawn silhouette may lead to a better rigging result.\nBesides manually drawing it, the following functions may be used to generate a silhouette:\nBlender\u0026rsquo;s Fill tool with the inverted direction. Smart Fill tool of this add-on. Besides using the generated mesh, you can also assign an arbitrary mesh object, or all mesh objects from a collection as the source. For example, this option may be useful when drawing strokes on the surface of a 3D object to keep their bone animation consistent. In that case, please make sure to change to mapping option to 3D Nearest Vertex.\nUse Hints to Generate Pins\r#\rThe Pins from Hints button is another rigging tool that can be used for rubber hose animations of limbs. It does not require an existing armature as the input. Instead, by drawing some hint strokes, the operator will generate bones at the same position, and then rig the Grease Pencil using these bones by setting weights to nearby points.\nIt is recommended to add a Smooth modifier after the Armature modifier if the point movement looks unnatural.\rHint Strokes\r#\rThe hint strokes should be drawn in a separate layer. Each stroke\u0026rsquo;s start and end position determine the placement of a bone. All other point/stroke attributes have no impact on the result.\nEach hint stroke should be drawn at the middle of a limb and perpendicular to it. It should intersect with the limb\u0026rsquo;s outlines at both ends.\nBone Styles\r#\rThere are several options to transform the generated bones:\nBone Style: This determines whether the bone should start from the hint\u0026rsquo;s center (Half) or start point (Full). Bone Rotation: Setting it to +90 or -90 degrees can make the bones parallel to the limb. Set Bone Parent: This option sets the parent relationship between bones according to the drawn sequence of hints and the relative position. Please notice that the result usually need manual adjustment.

One contains all non-Grease-Pencil objects, and the other is the scene background.\nCompatibility\r#\rDespite its popularity, the .psd file format is designed for internal use within Adobe software, but not for interchange. Given this and the difference between vector, raster and 3D graphics, only a limited subset of features is supported.\nDuring rendering, the following restrictions apply:\nLayer masks are not supported, because Photoshop has different mechanisms for representing masks. Z-ordering in 3D space may not be preserved in the rendered image. Compression algorithms are not implemented yet. Rendered file size may be large.

It fills an entire line art layer based on some color hints marked by the user. Compared with the Blender\u0026rsquo;s default Fill tool, it has the following advantages:\nIt handles the gaps in the line art automatically. It is less likely to leave seams near the contour, or be intersected. Although the algorithms are different, the concept of this operation is similar to the Colorize Mask tool in Krita.\nInput/Output Layers\r#\rThe operation takes two input layers, one containing the line art (Line Layer), and the other containing the color hint strokes (Hint Layer). They must be distinct layers.\nThe operation then generates new strokes in an output layer (Fill Layer). It is possible, but not recommended to use the same layer as Fill and Hint, since it will be difficult to distinguish the output strokes from the input ones. To overcome it, there is an option specifying to use only Boundary Strokes as hints.\nHint Strokes\r#\rPoints in the hint strokes will force the nearby areas be filled with the same color. The color of a hint point is determined in the following way:\nIf the stroke/point has a vertex color, use it as hint. Otherwise, use its material color. If the stroke has its fill visible, use the fill color as hint. Otherwise, use the line color. Only the position and color of the hint strokes have an impact. Other point/stroke attributes, including the line thickness and strength will not affect the result.\nYou can use fill materials for the hint strokes. But only its contour points will be taken into account. The inner part has no effect.\rOutput Materials\r#\rThere are different ways to assign materials to the newly generated fill strokes:\nUse the same materials (and vertex colors if exist) as hint strokes. Use an existing material. Generate vertex fill colors for each stroke. For each color used as hints, generate a new material. If you tend to use existing materials, please make sure they are not line-only ones.\n(The example image used in this page is Portrait of Olga by Pablo Picasso in 1920.)\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/nijigp/docs/tips/","title":"Tips","section":"Docs","content":""},{"id":17,"href":"/nijigp/docs/functionality/io/vectorizing_images/","title":"Vectorizing Images","section":"- Import/Export -","content":"\rVectorizing Images\r#\rThe Trace Image to Grease Pencil tool of Blender is limited to black and white input images. NijiGPen provides with operators vectorizing another two types of raster images.\nThese operators take either a single image or an image sequence as the input, and generate new strokes in the current Grease Pencil layer. The direction of the generated strokes is parallel to the current 2D working plane.\nSketches: Extracting the Line Art\r#\rThe Line Art button is an operator to convert an image to line-only strokes. It is recommended to select a material without fills enabled.\nCompared with most SVG-based editing software, an advantage of extracting the line art in Blender is the ability to preserve the thickness and color of the strokes, stored as point attributes.\nMedian Filter\r#\rSetting a non-zero value in the Median Filter Radius option will enable the median filter.\nThe filter should be used when the input image has heavy noise or grain. However, a large radius may also lower the processing speed and ignore some details from the image. Color Images: Quantization\r#\rThe Flat Color button is an operator that reduces the number of distinct colors used in an image. Then, each color of the image is traced separately to generate Grease Pencil strokes.\nYou can choose to either generate a new material for each color, or use a single material with multiple vertex fill colors.\nThis operator aims at color paintings in the flat style, rather than images with rich and gradient colors, e.g., real-world photos.\nIncreasing the number of colors in the import option may lead to better results for the latter case, but also causes a much longer processing time, and the result may still be far from ideal.\nGenerate Line Colors\r#\rThis method mainly focuses on the fill color of generated strokes, while there is also an option to determine whether the same color should be assigned to the line points.\nThe thickness and strength of the line are determined by the current brush.\nGenerate a Palette\r#\rAlong with the stroke generation, a palette can be generated which contains the colors extracted from the image. On the other hand, a palette can also be used as the input of the Color Source option, specifying which colors should be extracted. This may have the following use cases:\nTo import multiple images and guarantee their color sets are consistent. To perform the color transfer, i.e., applying the color style of one image to another image. Min Stroke Length\r#\rTo clarify, this option actually determines whether to ignore a shape by its area. For example, with this option setting to 16px, traced shapes with an area less than 256px^2 will not be converted to a stroke.\nShapes with 0 or a very small area may lead to problems when performing polygon or mesh generation operations. This option can filter them out.\n(The example images used in this page are Portrait of Olga by Pablo Picasso in 1920, and The Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh in 1889.)\n"},{"id":18,"href":"/nijigp/docs/functionality/animation/","title":"- Animations -","section":"Functionality","content":""},{"id":19,"href":"/nijigp/docs/developer_notes/","title":"Developer Notes (TODO)","section":"Docs","content":""},{"id":20,"href":"/nijigp/docs/functionality/io/","title":"- Import/Export -","section":"Functionality","content":""},{"id":21,"href":"/nijigp/docs/","title":"Docs","section":"Introduction","content":""}]
