      <description>Mesh Generation#NijiGPen allows users to convert a Grease Pencil stroke to a mesh object (either planar or 3D). This can have multiple usages, such as:
Adding the 3D shading effect to a 2D painting. Quick modeling from sketches. A stroke will be treated as a closed shape during mesh generation. Therefore, the line-only strokes may look different after the generation. You may either ignore them in the options or convert them to outlines first.</description>

      <description>Mesh Management#During the mesh generation, since each stroke will be converted to a separate mesh object, it is common to have many objects generated from the same Grease Pencil painting. This page will discuss the methods and options to handle multiple generated objects.
Multi-Object Alignment#This section exists in each mesh generation operator&#39;s option panel, defining how multiple generated meshes are aligned in the depth dimension.</description>
