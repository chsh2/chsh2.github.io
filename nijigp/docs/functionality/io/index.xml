      <description>Brush Import#Through the Import/Export sidebar panel, the user can load brushes of some other painting software&#39;s file formats into Blender and extract their textures to create Grease Pencil materials/brushes. Currently, the following formats are supported:
.abr brushes that are commonly used in Adobe Photoshop, GIMP and Krita. .gbr brushes of GIMP. .brush or .brushset files exported from Procreate. .sut brushes exported from Clip Studio Paint. Please be sure to follow the license and terms of service of the original brush, especially for those acquired from an asset store, which usually prohibits some behaviors such as redistribution.</description>

      <description>Palette Import#Through the Import/Export sidebar panel, the user can import some palette/swatch files which contain color information. The add-on will convert them to Blender palettes. Currently, the following file formats are supported:
.aco files used by Adobe Photoshop and Clip Studio Paint. .swatches files used by Procreate. .xml files used by some online color scheme services such as Adobe Color. Text that contains hex color codes. Hex codes separated by either space or any symbol can be recognized, such as: #FFEE93 #F5D782 #E97878 #9B5151 ffee93f5d782e978789b5151 f3c969,edff86,fff5b2,d4fcc3,362c28 [&amp;quot;f3c969&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;edff86&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;fff5b2&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;d4fcc3&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;362c28&amp;quot;] Import Options#Tints and Shades: This option generates multiple variants of each color imported, by changing the brightness of imported color.</description>

      <description>SVG Import#Though Blender has its native function to import an SVG file as Grease Pencil, this add-on provides with another import operator extending the native one for more use scenarios. The operator has the following differences from the native one:
SVG will be directly appended to the active Grease Pencil object, instead of creating a new one. The operator can be used in Draw and Edit mode, while the native one requires switching to Object mode.</description>

      <description>Image Import#The Trace Image to Grease Pencil tool of Blender is limited to black and white input images. NijiGPen provides with operators vectorizing another two types of raster images.
These operators take either a single image or an image sequence as the input, and generate new strokes in the current Grease Pencil layer. The direction of the generated strokes is parallel to the current 2D working plane.</description>

      <description>PSD Render#The Multi-Layer PSD Render button renders each layer of the Grease Pencil object to a separate image, and then merge them together to a .psd file. The name, blend mode of each layer and the sequence of layers will be preserved. In this way, the image can be further edited in various popular image editing or painting software.
Besides the Grease Pencil layers, there are two additional PSD layers rendered.</description>
