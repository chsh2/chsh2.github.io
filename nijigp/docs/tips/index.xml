      <description>Scene Setup#Blender comes with a template start file &amp;ldquo;2D Animation&amp;rdquo; that is convenient for painting.

      <description>Limitations#The add-on has a number of limitations in different aspects, including:
Unfinished features of the add-on itself, which may be improved in future releases. Limitations due to Blender&amp;rsquo;s own design, which may lead to different behaviors from common graphics software. This page lists limitations which are general to multiple operators. Besides it, the constraints of 2D space can be found in Basic Usage. The limitation of each single operator will be recorded in their own page.</description>
