      <description>Python Packages#NijiGPen&amp;rsquo;s functionality relies on some third-party Python packages, which have to be separately downloaded and installed. If you have no experience with Blender add-ons that have similar requirements, it is strongly suggested to read this page before using the add-on.
Dependency Summary#The table below lists the packages required for each type of operation. Lacking a package will not affect operations that do not require it.</description>

      <description>Scene Setup#Blender comes with a template start file &amp;ldquo;2D Animation&amp;rdquo; that is convenient for painting. However, there are also some tricky parts in setting up the scene, especially when we put Grease Pencil and 3D objects in the same scene, including the meshes generated by this add-on. Here are some tips written in the form of FAQ.
Why cannot I see any shading effect when I generate meshes from Grease Pencil?</description>

      <description>Basic Usage#User Interface#NijiGPen creates new user interfaces to trigger its functions in the following places of Blender.
Sidebar Panels#A tab named NijiGP will appear in the sidebar of the 3D Viewport, if the active object is Grease Pencil and the mode is Draw, Edit or Weight Paint. This is the major way of calling NijiGPen&amp;rsquo;s functions.
NijiGPen operators are categorized in several panels. Depending on the current mode, different panels or operators may appear.</description>

      <description>Limitations#The add-on has a number of limitations in different aspects, including:
Unfinished features of the add-on itself, which may be improved in future releases. Limitations due to Blender&amp;rsquo;s own design, which may lead to different behaviors from common graphics software. Shape of a Stroke#The performance of the add-on may deteriorate with input strokes of certain shapes:
Please avoid using self-overlapping strokes. Unlike common vector formats such as SVG, Blender does not define a fill rule and the rendering of the overlapping parts cannot be guaranteed.</description>
